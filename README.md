This is just a WIP tasks mod

**TODO:**

0: Create github issue page or template or w/e
1: Create a tast tracker IRL so I know what to do next kinda like with my dragon bot
2: Clean up the GUI
3: Create this funky UI panel that has an image of the block and its name next to it.
4: Somehow attach and detach it when the text field changes, or just use a toggle button in these early stages
~~5: Work on the search function~~~
6: On Done clicked: Ensure that the recipe/block is valid, then hook it onto the screen.
7: Optimization
8: Testing for newer forge versions
9: Backport to 1.14 to keep with LTS spec?
10: ???
